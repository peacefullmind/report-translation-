Comment
Nancy	is	a	reliable	and	attentive	student.	However,	she	rarely
contributes	to	class	discussion	unless	specifically	invited	to	do	so.
Nancy's	end	of	year	exam	result	is	broadly	in	line	with	other	prior
assessments.	I	do	not	doubt	that	Nancy	had	revised	for	the	exam.
Indeed,	for	the	essay	question	she	demonstrated	perfect
knowledge	of	the	three	elasticity	concepts,	but	such	knowledge
gets	small	reward.	Nancy	needs	to	apply	that	knowledge	and
evaluate.	This	she	finds	hard	to	do,	and	I	feel	that	her	modest
command	of	English	stands	in	the	way	of	her	understanding	the
questions	and	providing	clear	responses.	The	biggest	thing	that
Nancy	can	do	over	the	holiday	to	help	her	chances	of	success	in
economics	is	to	read	and	write	English	as	much	as	possible	to
improve	her	ability	to	access	the	questions.

Comment
Nancy’s	score	in	the	April	IELTS	exam	was	a	fair	reflection	of	her
English.	The	overall	score	of	5.5	indicates	that	she	has	a	long	way
to	go	to	raise	her	language	to	the	level	required	to	ensure	good
grades	at	A	Level,	and	to	support	university	study.	The	6	in	the
reading	component	was	good.	However,	Nancy	must	redouble	her
efforts	in	the	forthcoming	year	to	improve	her	English	in	all	areas.
Ideally,	study	over	the	summer	would	help	her	prepare	for	Year	13
A-level.

Comment
It	is	clear	that	Nancy	is	capable	of	abstract	thought	and	she	has
demonstrated	a	commendable	level	of	algebraic	skill.
Unfortunately	her	performance	in	exams	so	far	has	been	hindered
by	her	understanding	of	the	questions.	It	is	important	that	she
supports	her	mathematical	studies	with	a	concerted	effort	to
improve	her	reading	and	speaking	in	English.	She	can	do	this	by
contributing	more	to	class	discussions	and	engaging	in
conversation	in	English	with	her	peers	more	often.	If	Nancy	is	able
to	improve	her	understanding	of	the	language	I	am	confident	her
grade	will	improve	too.

Comment
Nancy	is	such	as	personable	and	positive	young	woman,	who	has
been	a	lovely	addition	to	the	school	community.	Her	reports	are
encouraging	and	certainly	show	that	she	is	heading	in	the	right
direction,	but	there	is	one	simple	message:	her	A-level	grades	will
be	below	her	potential	unless	her	command	of	the	English
language	improves.	I	have	seen	a	number	of	students	from	South
East	Asia	brush	this	issue	under	the	carpet	and	pay	the	price	in
the	end.	I	really	hope	Nancy	avoids	this	pitfall.

Comment
Nancy	has	worked	hard	throughout	the	year.	She	has	an	excellent
set	of	algebraic	skills	that	she	puts	to	good	use.	Her	exam	results
of	73%	and	57%	are	lower	than	she	is	capable	of.	These	are	due
to	Nancy	struggling	with	work	that	requires	interpretation	from
questions	where	the	level	of	English	is	demanding.	I	know	that
Nancy	will	work	hard	to	address	this	next	year.	She	always	hands
work	in	on	time	and	has	made	every	attempt	to	clear	up	problems
before	the	next	lesson.	I	would	encourage	Nancy	to	talk	to	me
when	she	is	unsure	of	her	work.

Comment
There	are	many	positive	comments	from	Nancy’s	subject	teachers
and	she	must	be	congratulated	for	the	effort	that	she	puts	into
her	work.	Nancy	is	a	quiet	student,	and	I	suspect	that	this	is	due
to	both	shyness	and	a	lack	of	confidence	in	her	spoken	English,
but	over	the	year	her	confidence	has	grown,	and	she	is	much
more	willing	to	make	conversation.	It	is	clear	from	her	subject
reports	that	she	is	trying	hard	but	effective	learning	is	not	just
about	putting	in	long	hours	of	study,	it	also	requires	asking	for
help	when	unsure	and	seeking	out	additional	support	when	it	is
needed.	Nancy	has	hopes	for	high	grades	and	she	has	been
frustrated	by	her	performance	in	some	of	the	assessed	work
during	this	term.	Her	subject	teachers	are	all	agreed	that	it	is	her
command	of	English	that	is	the	most	limiting	factor,	in	terms	of
her	progress.	Having	seen	how	her	confidence	has	slowly	grown
when	I	see	her	each	morning	for	registration,	I	hope	that	she	is
able	to	push	herself	forward	to	speak	up	in	her	lessons,	as	this
will	accelerate	her	English	skills	considerably.	Nancy	attended	a
Higher	Education	Day	earlier	this	term	and	I	hope	that	this	has
given	her	food	for	thought.	Now	the	summer	exams	are
completed,	students	will	start	on	their	UCAS	applications.

Comment
Nancy	joined	West	Buckland	in	Year	12	and,	although	her
involvement	in	House	activities	has	been	limited	to	the	cross-
country	runs,	I	hope	that	she	has	enjoyed	being	a	member	of	the
Fortescue.	Nancy	has	demonstrated	a	good	work	ethic;	she	is
organised	and	able	to	meet	deadlines	and	exhibits	a	positive
attitude,	which	will,	I	am	sure,	help	her	to	achieve	success	in	her
chosen	career	path.	Well	done,	Nancy,	and	good	luck!

Comment
Nancy	has	had	a	fantastic	year.	She	is	a	well-mannered,	friendly
and	delightful	young	lady.	It	has	been	rewarding	to	see	her
confidence	develop	throughout	the	year	and	I	hope	she	is	proud
of	all	she	has	accomplished	socially.	She	has	continued	to	create
a	contented,	fulfilling	and	very	rewarding	boarding	life.	Nancy
continues	to	conduct	herself	in	a	gracious	manner	at	all	times
and	her	etiquette	is	flawless.	She	is	sensible	in	getting	enough
sleep	each	night	as	she	leads	a	very	busy	life.	She	is	a	diligent
student	who	works	productively	in	prep	time	and	beyond,	always
looking	neat,	tidy	and	ready	to	go	on	time	each	day.	Nancy	has
one	of	the	best	dressed	rooms	in	the	house	and	it	is	always	a
pleasure	to	visit	her	and	see	the	time	and	care	she	puts	into
looking	after	herself	and	her	living	space.
